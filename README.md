## Improvements

## Warning

First bigger project using React Testing Library. Definitely challenging. I felt the need to come back a little and dig a bit deeper to fully understand the concepts with smaller projects and dedicated React Testing course, starting with 'React Testing Mastery' (https://codewithmosh.com/p/react-testing-mastery). I'll update this project with better testing coverage when I'll have a bit more under my belt.
